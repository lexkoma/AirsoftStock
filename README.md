# AirsoftStock
JavaFX desktop application for working with airsoft items in the Google Sheets as "database".So, application has to simplyfy  manual work of inserting, coping, etc between spreadsheets.
Not finished for logical end (doesn't make changes in spreadsheets yet, but works in runtime). Has a lot of commented code.
